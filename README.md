This project was implemented during the fifth year of my undergraduate program and centers on the creation of a Chord distributed hash table (DHT) system. Chord is a protocol and algorithm used in distributed systems to efficiently locate the node that stores a particular data item. It achieves this by organizing nodes in a circular structure, enabling scalable, efficient data lookup and retrieval in large, decentralized networks.

In this project, data was collected through a custom-built web crawler, which performed web scraping on various Wikipedia pages to gather relevant information. This data was then stored within the Chord system, where the distributed hash table facilitates quick access and management across multiple nodes in a decentralized manner. This project demonstrates both foundational knowledge in distributed systems and practical skills in data scraping and processing.
